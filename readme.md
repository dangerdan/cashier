## Introduction

CakePHP Teller is a port of Laravel Cashier, providing an expressive, fluent interface to [Stripe's](https://stripe.com) subscription billing services for CakePHP3. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.
